# Python implementation

## Partial example

```python
import GMatLinearElastic.Cartesian3d as GMat

shape = [...]
K = np.empty(shape)
G = np.empty(shape)
epsy = np.empty(shape + [1])
...

GMat.CuspXd model(K, G, epsy);
...

Eps = np.empty(shape + [3, 3])
...

model.Eps = Eps
print(model.Sig)
```

## Installation

### Using conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge python-gmatelastoplasticqpot
```

Note that *xsimd* and hardware optimisations are **not enabled**.
To enable them you have to compile on your system, as is discussed next.

### From source

>   You need *xtensor*, *xtensor-python* and optionally *xsimd* as prerequisites.
>   The easiest is to use *conda* to get the prerequisites:
>
>   ```bash
>   conda install -c conda-forge xtensor xsimd xtensor-python
>   ```
>
>   If you then compile and install with the same environment you should be good to go.
>   Otherwise, a bit of manual labour might be needed to treat the dependencies.

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/tdegeus/GMatElastoPlasticQPot.git
cd GMatElastoPlasticQPot

# Only if you want to use hardware optimisation:
export SKBUILD_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="-DUSE_SIMD=1"

python -m pip install . -v
```

# C++ implementation

## Partial example

```cpp
#include <GMatElastoPlasticQPot/Cartesian2d.h>

namespace GMat = GMatElastoPlasticQPot::Cartesian2d;

int main()
{
    static const size_t rank = ...;

    xt::xtensor<double, rank> K = ...;
    xt::xtensor<double, rank> G = ...;
    xt::xtensor<double, rank + 1> epsy = ...;

    GMat::CuspXd model(K, G, epsy);
    ...

    xt::xtensor<double, rank + 2> Eps;
    ...

    // all necessary computation are done at this point
    model.set_Eps(Eps);
    ...

    // get reference to stress
    auto Sig = elastic.Sig();

    return 0;
}
```

## Debugging

To enable assertions define `GMATELASTOPLASTICQPOT_ENABLE_ASSERT`
**before** including *GMatElastoPlasticQPot* for the first time.

Using *CMake* this can be done using the `GMatElastoPlasticQPot::assert` target.

>   To also enable assertions of *xtensor* also define `XTENSOR_ENABLE_ASSERT`
>   **before** including *xtensor* (and *GMatElastoPlasticQPot*) for the first time.
>
>   Using *CMake* all assertions are enabled using the `GMatElastoPlasticQPot::debug` target.

## Installation

### Using conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gmatelastoplasticqpot
```

### From source

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/tdegeus/GMatElastoPlasticQPot.git
cd GMatElastoPlasticQPot

cmake -Bbuild
cd build
cmake --install .
```

## Compiling

## Using CMake

### Example

Your `CMakeLists.txt` can be as follows

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
project(example)
find_package(GMatElastoPlasticQPot REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE GMatElastoPlasticQPot)
```

### Targets

The following targets are available:

*   `GMatElastoPlasticQPot`
    Includes *GMatElastoPlasticQPot* and the *xtensor* dependency.

*   `GMatElastoPlasticQPot::assert`
    Enables assertions by defining `GMATELASTOPLASTICQPOT_ENABLE_ASSERT`.

*   `GMatElastoPlasticQPot::debug`
    Enables all assertions by defining
    `GMATELASTOPLASTICQPOT_ENABLE_ASSERT` and `XTENSOR_ENABLE_ASSERT`.

*   `GMatElastoPlasticQPot::compiler_warings`
    Enables compiler warnings (generic).

### Optimisation

It is advised to think about compiler optimisation and enabling *xsimd*.
Using *CMake* this can be done using the `xtensor::optimize` and `xtensor::use_xsimd` targets.
The above example then becomes:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
project(example)
find_package(GMatElastoPlasticQPot REQUIRED)
find_package(xtensor REQUIRED)
find_package(xsimd REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE
    GMatElastoPlasticQPot
    xtensor::optimize
    xtensor::use_xsimd)
```

See the [documentation of xtensor](https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) concerning optimisation.

## By hand

Presuming that the compiler is `c++`, compile using:

```
c++ -I/path/to/GMatElastoPlasticQPot/include ...
```

Note that you have to take care of the *xtensor* dependency, the C++ version, optimisation,
enabling *xsimd*, ...

## Using pkg-config

Presuming that the compiler is `c++`, compile using:

```
c++ `pkg-config --cflags GMatElastoPlasticQPot` ...
```

Note that you have to take care of the *xtensor* dependency, the C++ version, optimization,
enabling *xsimd*, ...

# Upgrading instructions

## Upgrading to >v0.17.*

The individual material point and the array of material points was fully integrated.
In addition, the number of copies was reduced.

**Important** the sequence of yield strains is now taken as is.
It will not prepended with `- epsy[:, 0]` as was default with `init_elastic`.

### C++

There is only a single class `Elastic`. It's functions where renamed:

*   `.setStrain(...)` -> `.set_Eps(...)`
*   `.Stress()` -> `.Sig()` (now returns a reference).
*   `.stress(...)`: deprecated.
*   `.Tangent()` -> `.C()` (now returns a reference).
*   `.tangent(...)`: deprecated.

### Python

There is only a single class `Elastic`. It's functions are converted to properties:

*   `.setStrain(...)` -> `.Eps = ...`
*   `.Stress()` -> `.Sig` (now returns a reference).
*   `.stress(...)`: deprecated.
*   `.Tangent()` -> `.C` (now returns a reference).
*   `.tangent(...)`: deprecated.

## Upgrading to v0.10.*

`Array<rank>.check` should be replaced by something like:
```cpp
if (xt::any(xt::equal(array.type(), Type::Unset))) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Please set all points");
}
```
Note however that it is no longer required to set all points,
unset points are filled-up with zeros.

## Upgrading to >v0.8.*

`xtensor_fixed` was completely deprecated in v0.8.0, as were the type aliases
`Tensor2` and `Tensor4`.
Please update your code as follows:

*   `Tensor2` -> `xt::xtensor<double, 2>`.
*   `Tensor4` -> `xt::xtensor<double, 4>`.

**Tip:** Used `auto` as return type as much as possible.
This simplifies implementation, and renders is less subjective to library
return type changes.

## Upgrading to >v0.6.*

Compared to v0.5.0, v0.6.1 has some generalisations and efficiency updates.
This requires the following changes:

*   `Matrix` has been generalised to `Array<rank>`. Practically this requires changing:
    -   `Matrix` to `Array<2>` in C++.
    -   `Matrix` to `Array2d` in Python.
        Note that `Array1d`, `Array3d`, are also available.

*   Strain is now stored as a member.
    Functions like `stress` now return the state based on the last specified strain,
    specified using `setStrain(Esp)`. This leads to the following changes:
    - `stress`: no argument.
    - `tangent`: no argument, single return value (no longer returns stress).
    - `find`: no argument, renamed to `currentIndex`.
    - `epsy`: replaced by `currentYieldLeft` and `currentYieldRight`.

*   By storing strain as a member,
    efficiency upgrades have been made to find the position in the potential energy landscape.
    The library therefore now depends on [QPot](https://www.github.com/tdegeus/QPot).

## v0.6.0

    -   `Matrix` to `Array<2>` in C++.
    -   `Matrix` to `Array2d` in Python.

*   Strain is now stored as a member.
    Functions like `stress` now return the state based on the last specified strain,
